# Fraud-Detection
This is a fraud detection model built with 6.3million rows data. Built ML model for classification of fraud detection. But the data was highly imbalanced ( 99.87:0.13 ) so can't use sampling techniques, model can't classify if he is actually a Fraud. Used startify at data splitting and  focused on Precision and Recall at evaluation using threshold.
